	<div> 
		<p class="aboutuspage">WHAT DO YOU DO IF YOU ARE UNABLE TO MAKE A CHOICE? DO YOU FLIP A COIN, OR MAYBE YOU 
		THINK ABOUT THE PROS AND CONS? WHAT IF THERE WAS A BETTER WAY TO MAKE DECISIONS. WHEN YOU
		USE CHOICEMAKER, IT CALCULATES AND TELLS YOU A PERCENTAGE WHICH REPRESENTS YOUR LIKELIHOOD 
		OF DOING THAT CHOICE. THE HIGHER THE PERCENTAGE, THE BETTER YOUR LIKELIHOOD OF PERFORMING 
		THAT CHOICE. ALL IT NEEDS IS YOUR VARIABLES. LET'S SAY FOR EXAMPLE, YOU WERE CONFLICTED 
		ABOUT DRINKING SODA. YOU WOULD HAVE TO INPUT VARIABLES SUCH AS: HOW THIRSTY YOU ARE, 
		HOW MUCH YOU LIKE THE SODA, ETC. AFTER YOU INPUT THESE VARIABLES, YOU HAVE TO SPECIFY HOW 
		IMPORTANT AND SIGNIFICANT THE VARIABLE IS TO YOU ON A SCALE OF 1 TO 10.
